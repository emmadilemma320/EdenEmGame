There are many different types of resources in our game, and multiple sources to get them from.
Some of the main ways to get resources are: merchants in town (both specialized and general), helping npcs with ailments, collecting them from the ground, and growing plants/flowers in window boxes, flower beds, and flower pots.
Different areas, npcs, and growables will contain different resources, so it is good for players to explore all areas and talk to many different townsfolk. 
Players can also dry herbs on drying racks to unlock new potentials of herbs.
