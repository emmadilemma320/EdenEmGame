General Game Outline/Summary:
	The main theme of our game "Forest Witch" is connecting with nature and those around us. Thus, the focus is on gethering plants and herbs
	to use in potions to help those around you. There is a small town with many interesting characters to meet, befriend, any even romance. 
	We wanted to avoid a feeling of subduing/taming nature (both by the main character and 'bbeg's), so we have avoided several key features that occur
	in most cozy, nature-themed games: 
		1) farming: we will have no tilling or farming in our game. You can still have planters/windboxes, but we want to avoid
	farming in a grand sense, especially tilling. 
		2) automation: many farming games add automation such a sprinklers, auto-planters/harvesters, etc. to make it easier
	for the player late-game; this felt a little too "taming nature" for us, so in our game once you've helped the town enough, they like you enough to have one of the 
	local kids gather your supplies up and bring it to you; all they ask is you give you a list of what you'll need 
		3) "big bag evil corporation": many of these games have a big bad evil corporation, that hopes to
	destroy the nature/town/farm the player lives in. While we do not dislike this in other games, this was a direction we wanted to go in. In our game all characters,
	be it PCs or NPCs, work in tandem with nature rather than against it. 
		4) "deforestation start": in many cozy farming games, you start by clearing a plot of land of trees and debris. While I admit these are very satisfying, cutting down 
	trees in that way goes against the core theme of our game. instead, you start with a small house that expand using magic (more on this in the HouseDesign doc).
For more info about specific aspects and game mechanics, see the various docs in our GameDesign folder!
