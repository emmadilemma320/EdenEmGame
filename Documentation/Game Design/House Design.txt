The player's house starts with just two rooms: a bed/main room and a greenhouse/ magic room. As the player progresses,
they can magically expand the inside, adding new rooms and even an upstairs/basement. However, the outside stays the same it always was.
This is a play on how in many cozy games, the inside of your house expands but the outside stays the same. That being said, you can decorate
the outside of your house and change the roof/style.
